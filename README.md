 This project is a part of the ADS-505 course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego. 

-- Project Status: [Completed]

## Installation

To use this project on your own machine, follow these instructions:

git init

git clone https://github.com/lanewhitmore/Covid_Classification_NYSE.git

## Project Objectives

This project sets out to indentify how student performance can classify either as Pre-Covid (the three years leading up to covid) and Covid the full 20-21 school year during Covid. The Schools' Counties were used to group the data. The data subgroup names the majority for the school's area.


## Methods Used

Data Pre-Processing
Machine Learning
Classification Methods: Neural Network, Naive Bayes, Bagging Method, Boosting, Random Forest, Cart
AUC/ROC evaluation

## Technologies

Python

## Project Description

This Dataset has been acquired from NYSED. The team has decided that identifying the performance differences between COVID and NON-COVID school years could reveal how the pandemic has effected New York Schools. This model would also be able to classify future school years to identify if COVID has left a hangover effect after the pandemic has passed.
